# Collector Craft
> An open-world turn-based RPG built with Phaser 3.

## Prologue

The story begins at a very difficult time. An unknown virus has taken over Mapple Town.
Peoples who are affected by the virus have turned into zombies. They wander around the streets 
and attack others. 

Throughout the town, 10 gold coins are scattered. These 10 gold coins are the last hope of this town. The combination of these 10 coins can give us the secret formula for the 
vaccine.

Your goal is to collect all the 10 coins. In your adventure, you will face the zombies randomly.
You will have to fight them in a turn-based fight.
